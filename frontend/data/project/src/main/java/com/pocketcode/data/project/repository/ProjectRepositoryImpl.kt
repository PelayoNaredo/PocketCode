/**
 * This is an implementation of the `ProjectRepository` from the domain layer.
 * It handles all data operations related to projects, such as creating, reading,
 * and saving them.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Implement the functions defined in the `ProjectRepository` interface (from `:domain:project`).
 * - A typical implementation would use a "single source of truth" strategy.
 * - It fetches data from a remote source (via a network client) and saves it to a local
 *   database (via a DAO from `:core:storage`).
 * - The data is then served to the domain layer from the local database.
 * - It also handles local filesystem operations, like creating project folders and files.
 *
 * Interacts with:
 * - `:domain:project`: Implements interfaces and uses models from this module.
 * - `:core:storage`: Uses DAOs and filesystem helpers to manage local data.
 * - `:core:network`: May use an HTTP client to sync project data with the cloud.
