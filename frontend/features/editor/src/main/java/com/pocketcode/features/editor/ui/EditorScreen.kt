/**
 * This is the main composable for the Editor feature screen.
 * It is responsible for displaying the entire editor UI, including the code editor,
 * toolbars, and file explorer.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Observe state from the `EditorViewModel`.
 * - Render the UI based on the current state (e.g., show file content, display errors).
 * - Delegate user events (e.g., button clicks, text input) to the ViewModel.
 * - It is the top-level composable for this feature and will be added to the
 *   main navigation graph in the `:app` module.
 *
 * Interacts with:
 * - `EditorViewModel`: Gets state and sends events.
 * - `:core:ui`: Uses shared components like `TopAppBar`, `AppTheme`.
 * - Child composables within this module (e.g., `CodeEditor`, `FileExplorerPanel`).
