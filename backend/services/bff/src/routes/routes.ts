// This file (or directory) will define the API routes for the BFF service.
// For example, it might contain routes like:
// - `POST /projects`: To create a new project.
// - `GET /projects/{id}`: To get project details.
// - `POST /builds`: To trigger a new build.
//
// Each route handler will process the incoming request, call the relevant
// services, and return a response tailored for the mobile client.
//
// Interacts with:
// - `../services/`: Contains the business logic that these routes will invoke.
// - `index.ts`: Where these routes are registered with the main server application.
