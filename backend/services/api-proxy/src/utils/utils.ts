// This file (or directory) will contain utility functions for the API Proxy.
// For example, a function `getApiKey(userId)` could be defined here.
// This function would be responsible for securely retrieving the appropriate
// API key from Firestore or another secure storage mechanism.
//
// This helps keep the main `index.ts` file clean and focused on the proxying logic.
//
// Interacts with:
// - `Firestore`: To securely access the `users` collection for API keys.
