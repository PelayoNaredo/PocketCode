# This Dockerfile is used to containerize the Secure API Proxy service.
# It will define the environment, copy the source code, install dependencies,
# and specify the command to run the proxy server on Google Cloud Run.
# This service's primary role is to securely manage and inject API keys
# into requests to third-party services (e.g., AI platforms).
