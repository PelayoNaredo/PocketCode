# This Terraform file defines the input variables for the infrastructure configuration.
# It will include variables for:
# - `gcp_project_id`: The ID of the Google Cloud project.
# - `gcp_region`: The primary region for deploying resources (e.g., "us-central1").
# - `app_name`: A base name for services and resources.
#
# Using variables makes the Terraform configuration reusable across different
# environments (e.g., staging, production).
